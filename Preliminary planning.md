# Intital plans and project structure for the YFI-03 Purik prototype.

### Primary focus: sensor suite

1. Sensor suite (EOMSS)
	- Design the structure of EOMSS
	- Physical EOMSS set up
	- Preliminary testing (sensor data transmission, with oscilloscope, signal generator, IR remotes, etc.)
	
2. Land vehicle testing _as a seperate system_
	- Mount on Traxxas Telluride 4x4 electric RC platform
	- Test lateral and angular range, data transmission
	- Test rough-and-tumble connection with Telluride platform
